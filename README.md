Phishi-Watchi is an email threat analyzer web app built with Flask and Bootstrap. It helps analyze emails for potential phishing threats by scanning embedded links. It uses the Gmail API to retrieve emails from the users inbox, as well as the urlscan.io API to scan and retrieve the results of the links. The app was created for learning purposes and inspired by CCubed's Day 2 Workshop.
